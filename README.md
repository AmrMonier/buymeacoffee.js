## What is Buy Me A Coffee

Buy Me a Coffee is a simple, meaningful way to fund your creative work.

Without stitching together a bunch of apps like Patreon, Mailchimp, and a donate button â€” you can accept support, memberships, and build a direct relationship with your fans. [Create your account here](https://buymeacoff.ee/?via=WarenGonzaga).

## Features

- Simple
- Lightweight
- Supporters Data
- Subscriptions Data
- Extras Data
- Supports NodeJS v10+ LTS

(Read the [Official Docs](http://developers.buymeacoffee.com))

## Installation

```bash
npm install buymeacoffee.js
```

## Usage

First [get your personal access token here](http://developers.buymeacoffee.com/dashboard), then create a ``coffee.json`` file and save your personal access token inside. Example below.

```json
{
    "token":"access_token_here"
}
```

After that, create your Javascript file. Example below.

```js
const BMC = require('buymeacoffee.js'); // add BMC package
const access = require('./coffee.json'); // load your token
const coffee = new BMC(access.token); // add your token here

// retrieve supporters data
coffee.Supporters((data) => {
    console.log(data);
});

// retrieve subscribers data
coffee.Subscriptions((data) => {
    console.log(data);
});

// retrieve extras data
coffee.Extras((data) => {
    console.log(data);
});
```

You can play with the data and get specific information such as supporter name. Example below.

```js
coffee.Supporters((data) => {
    data = data.data[0].supporter_name;
    console.log(data);
});
```

I will add more features to this API Client as soon as I have time working on it.
